# Notes
to run the program, here are the commands to run:
make 
make ray-tracer
./ray-tracer -> if you just want to see the numbers only
./ray-tracer > [image_name].ppm -> this will take the pixel outputs and turn it into an actual image 

Once you are done, you want to run the command to clean up the executables:
make clean
